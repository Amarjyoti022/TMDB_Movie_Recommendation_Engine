It contains detailed metadata for each movie, including title, release year, genres, primary language, IMDb rating, runtime, summary, and direct YTS links.  

The data has been **cleaned and preprocessed** to make it ready for analysis and machine learning tasks:
- Removed duplicates and standardized formats.
- Handled missing values in genres, languages, ratings, and runtimes.
- Ensured compatibility for recommendation system development.

This dataset is suitable for **content-based filtering**, **collaborative filtering**, and **hybrid recommendation engines**, as well as **exploratory data analysis** and **visualization**.

It can also be used for:
